# Archaoeological Object Sharing

The goal of this project is to create a web space for the collaborative sharing of archaeological objects.  The users would be able to upload data, photographs, and 3d models of objects from archaeological excavations and surveys.  Material could include pottery sherds, stone tools, bones, etc.  The ultimate aim is that this forms a place where collections of artifacts can be directly compared with each other along multiple dimensions.  For example, comparing the colors of ceramic sherds, or the diameters (automatically extracted by 3d models) of bowls.  There could also be a mapping interface.

*Note:* This web app was initially developed as a class project in Fall 2016 for CIS557: Programming for the Web at the University of Pennslyvania (Instructor: Swapneel Sheth).  The original app team can be seen under contributors.  Development will continue with other partners.
